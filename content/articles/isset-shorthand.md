## Here are all the isset properties.

- ```top```
- ```right```
- ```bottom```
- ```left```

**Side note:** This is the order of your shorthand.

### This is the shorthand.

```css
.isset-shorthand-example {
  isset: 50% 0% 0% 50%;
}
```

It works with Positions relative & absolute.

This is the most used use case of all. The isset shorhand is one of the most rarely used shorthands.
