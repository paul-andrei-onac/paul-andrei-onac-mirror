## About 

I am an entirely committed and passionate Frontend Developer with a solid foundation in knowledge of web applications and websites. With over three years of experience, I embrace my work with dedication and understanding for users’ needs.

Being surrounded by technology for as long as I could remember, I took my first steps in web development with curiosity and eagerness to learn. My approach involves staying up-to-date with the emerging trends, frameworks and best practices, which allows me to design web projects that are both optimized for high performance and visually engaging.

Besides my technical skills, I am a candid, diligent and self-taught person, who thrives when working in a team based on collaboration and union. I believe the best solutions come from people who share similar visions and work together as a cross-functional team.
